- Documenting my own DevOps journey, pursuing my passion, and my projects

- If any doubts, or just want to collaborate with me, just contact me via
linkedin or here, it would be nice to see this project grow and reach out and
help as many people as possible (: 

- So... ALL COLLABORATION IS WELCOME (: 

Cheers!


PS: Every single note here was hand written by me so far, following videos projects or courses, no copy paste from other text sources.
