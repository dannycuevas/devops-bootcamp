# PACKAGES / MODULES / LIBRARIES

-When a developer develops code that can be "reused", they share it to the public community as "packages" that can be "reused"

-So they are also referred to as "modules" or "libraries", just depending on the programming language being used

-These could be libraries to help work with file systems,
    perform math operations,
    interact with operating systems,
    or packages for developing different kinds of applications like web-servers,
    implementing security networking, etc

-And so, applications use these packages in their code as "dependencies"

-These dependencies must be available for the applications to run; these dependencies are handled by different tools for different programming languages such as:
    NPM for nodejs
    PIPP for python
    etc

-Understanding the basics of "package management" can help you better understand "build processes" and aid in troubleshooting issues that may arise fue to "dependency" errors

-When an application is coded, it goes through a procedure of
    development
    build
    test
    delivery
and DevOps tries to automate those tasks with CI CD pipelines
