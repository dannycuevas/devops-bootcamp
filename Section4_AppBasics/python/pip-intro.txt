# PIP

-PIP is the package manager for python, and when you install pythobm it also installs PIP automatically, and as discussed before, you can have 2 separate versions of python installed on the same host (for example, python2 and python3)

-Check the version of your PIP, using capital "V" not "v"

pip2 -V

pip3 -V

-To install a package using PIP, use "pip install" with the package name

pip install PACKAGE
pip install flask

-When Python is installed, it creates its own directory for each version (example, Python3.6) under the path:

/usr/lib/python3.6

-So when you install a package, it installs it under /usr/lib/python* path, under the "site-packages" directory as each version has its own dedicated tree of directories including for the packages

-To see the location of a particular package installed, with the package name

pip show PACKAGE
pip show flask


### IMPORTING

-Once installed, a package is "imported" into the code using the "import statement"
-When a package is imported within an application, Python looks under a set of directories for the package

from flask import Flask, request

-And so to get a list of path that python looks for, you can print out the "sys.path" property, as this is the default location where python would look for packages

python2 -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"


# REQUIREMENTS

-Large applications have many many different packages to be installed, so instead of running the "pip install" command multiple times, you can either run a single command with all the packages (packages names in it)

pip install flask jinja2 markupsafe

-Or a better approach would be to move all the package details (names) inside a file name "requirements.txt" and then run the "pip install" command using the -r option and the file name

pip install -r requirements.txt

-Also if you like, you can specify the packages versions in that file, example:

Flask==0.10.1
Jinja2==2.7.3
MarkupSafe==0.23
Werkzeug==0.9.6
requests==2.3.0
gunicorn==18.0


# UPGRADE / UNINSTALL A PACKAGE

-To upgrade a package, run

pip install PACKAGE --upgrade

-To uninstall a package, run

pip uninstall PACKAGE
pip uninstall gunicorn
