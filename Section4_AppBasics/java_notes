# INTRO TO JAVA AND NOTES

-What does JDK mean?
=Java Development Kit

-Which tool is used for documenting your app with JDK?
=javadoc

-Which tool is used for compiling your app with JDK?
=javac

-Which tool is used for debugging your app with JDK?
=jdb

-Help us install java 20 inside /opt directory
=first lets download the app inside the /opt directory

sudo curl https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk20/bdc68b4b9cbc4ebcb30745c85038d91d/36/GPL/openjdk-20_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz --output /opt/openjdk-20_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

Then we uncompress the taz.gz file

sudo tar -xf /opt/openjdk-20_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz -C /opt/

To verify run ""/opt/jdk-20/bin/java -version"" and confirm correct version is installed

""openjdk version "20" 2023-03-21
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 20+36-2344)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 20+36-2344, mixed mode), sharing""

-We need to set java binary path in environment PATH variable to use java binaries. So that you can simply run java instead of the full path.
Once done, verify that you can invoke java simply by running java command.

=Set path variable with the command export PATH=$PATH:/opt/jdk-20/bin
